#### Problem Statement:

We work as analysts for the telecommunications operator Megaline. The company offers its customers two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department needs to determine which plan generates higher revenue in order to effectively adjust the advertising budget.

---

#### Objective:

We will conduct a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small customer sample. You will have data from 500 Megaline customers including: customer demographic information, their location, which plan they use, as well as the number of calls made and text messages sent during 2018. Your task is to analyze customer behavior and determine which prepaid plan generates higher revenue.

HYPOTHESES:

The average revenue from users of the Ultimate and Surf plans differs.

The average revenue from users in the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area is different from that of users in other regions.

#### Technologies used:

* PandasN
* Numpy
* Matplotlib (pyplot)
* Scipy (stats)
* Seaborn

#### Results:

Surf plan users tend to exceed the limits included in their package, resulting in additional charges.

Surf plan users generate higher revenue because they frequently exceed their plan limits.

Ultimate plan users, on average, consume more data than Surf plan users.

There is a significant difference in the average revenue between Ultimate and Surf plan users.
